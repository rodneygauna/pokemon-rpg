## Getting Started as a GM

### What is a Game Master?

As the **Game Master** (or **GM**), you're the guide, storyteller, and facilitator for the Pokemon RPG. Think of yourself as:

- **The Narrator**: You describe the world, situations, and what happens
- **The Director**: You help manage the flow of the story and keep things moving
- **The Teacher**: You help players learn the rules and develop skills
- **The Referee**: You make fair decisions about rules and outcomes
- **The Facilitator**: You make sure everyone has fun and gets to participate

**Most importantly**: You're not trying to "win" against the players. Your job is to help everyone have an amazing adventure together!

### Your Role and Responsibilities

#### During the Game

- **Describe the world**: Paint pictures with words about places, people, and Pokemon
- **Play NPCs**: Act as all the non-player characters the group meets
- **Ask for dice rolls**: Decide when rolls are needed and what stats to use
- **Interpret results**: Turn dice results into story outcomes
- **Keep things fair**: Make sure everyone gets chances to be the hero
- **Maintain safety**: Ensure content stays appropriate and everyone feels included

#### Outside the Game

- Character creation (stats, skills, professions)
- Pokemon mechanics (stages, types, moves)
- Basic gameplay flow

#### Step 2: Plan Your First Adventure

Start simple! Good first adventures include:

- **The Missing Pet Pokemon**: A beloved Pokemon has wandered off
- **The Mysterious Berry Grove**: Strange things are happening to the local berries
- **The New Trainer Welcome**: Help new trainers get their first Pokemon partner

#### Step 3: Prepare Your Space

- **Seating**: Everyone should see and hear each other
- **Lighting**: Good lighting for reading character sheets and seeing dice
- **Noise level**: Minimize distractions
- **Materials**: Dice, paper, pencils, character sheets ready

#### Step 4: Set Expectations

Let players know:

- How long the session will last
- Basic behavior expectations
- That it's okay to ask questions
- That everyone will get chances to be awesome

### Essential Materials

## Running the Game

### Session Structure

A typical Pokemon RPG session follows this structure:

#### Opening (5-10 minutes)

- **Welcome everyone**: Make sure all players are ready
- **Recap**: Briefly remind everyone what happened last time
- **Check characters**: Make sure everyone has their sheets and knows their stats
- **Set the scene**: Describe where the adventure begins

#### Main Adventure (30-60 minutes)

- **Present the situation**: Give players a problem to solve or goal to achieve
- **Explore and interact**: Let players ask questions and explore
- **Face challenges**: Present obstacles that require dice rolls and teamwork
- **Make choices**: Give players meaningful decisions that affect the story
- **Resolve conflicts**: Handle any battles or major challenges

#### Closing (5-10 minutes)

- **Wrap up the story**: Bring the current adventure to a satisfying conclusion
- **Award experience**: Give Pokemon EXP for their accomplishments
- **Preview next time**: Hint at what might happen in future sessions
- **Celebrate successes**: Acknowledge what players did well

### Managing Dice Rolls

#### When to Ask for Rolls

**DO ask for dice rolls when**:

- The outcome is uncertain
- Failure would be interesting, not just frustrating
- Success requires skill or effort
- The result will significantly impact the story

**DON'T ask for dice rolls when**:

- The action is routine or easy for the character
- Failure would stop the story
- The player has already described a clever solution
- You want something specific to happen for story reasons

#### Choosing the Right Stat

- **Knowledge**: Remembering facts, solving puzzles, understanding situations
- **Spirit**: Being brave, persisting through challenges, acting in danger
- **Friendship**: Communicating with others, inspiring teammates, showing empathy

**Tip**: If it could reasonably use multiple stats, let the player choose and explain their approach!

#### Setting the Dice Pool

**Base dice** = Character's stat rating (1-4 dice)

**Add extra dice for**:

- **Relevant skills** (+1 die)
- **Help from friends** (+1 die per helper, max 2)
- **Good ideas or clever plans** (+1 die)
- **Right tools for the job** (+1 die)
- **Pokemon assistance** (+1 die)
- **Type advantages** (+1 die when applicable)

**Maximum dice pool**: 8 dice (keep it manageable)

### Setting Difficulty

The number of successes needed determines how challenging a task is:

#### Difficulty Guidelines

- **Automatic Success** (0 successes needed): Routine tasks, clever solutions
- **Easy** (1 success needed): Simple challenges with room for complications
- **Moderate** (2 successes needed): Standard challenges requiring effort
- **Hard** (3 successes needed): Difficult tasks requiring skill or luck
- **Very Hard** (4+ successes needed): Nearly impossible tasks, rare situations

### Interpreting Results

#### Success Levels

**0 Successes (Failure)**:

- The plan doesn't work as intended
- Introduce a complication or setback
- Offer alternative approaches
- Keep the story moving forward

*Example*: "You try to sneak past the sleeping Snorlax, but you step on a twig. It wakes up and looks around confused. What do you do now?"

**1 Success (Success with Complications)**:

- The character succeeds at their goal
- Something unexpected happens too
- Creates new story opportunities
- Still feels like a win overall

*Example*: "You successfully identify the Pokemon as a Ditto, but your excitement causes you to speak loudly and it notices you watching!"

**2-3 Successes (Clear Success)**:

- The plan works as intended
- No major complications
- Player feels competent and successful
- Story progresses smoothly

*Example*: "You carefully approach the frightened Growlithe and speak gently. It stops whimpering and cautiously sniffs your hand."

**4+ Successes (Amazing Success)**:

- The plan works better than expected
- Additional benefits beyond the goal
- Player feels heroic and awesome
- Creates positive momentum

*Example*: "Not only do you calm the Growlithe, but it seems to really trust you! It starts wagging its tail and several other scared Pokemon come out to see what's happening."

#### Handling 1s (Complications)

When players roll 1s, especially multiple 1s, add interesting complications:

- **Story twists**: Unexpected developments that change the situation
- **Time pressure**: Things become more urgent
- **Resource costs**: Characters use up supplies or energy
- **Social complications**: NPCs react in unexpected ways
- **Environmental changes**: The situation becomes more challenging

**Important**: Complications should make the story more interesting, not punish players!

### Keeping the Story Moving

#### When Players Get Stuck

**Ask leading questions**:

- "What do you think your character would try?"
- "What would you like to know about this situation?"
- "How does your Pokemon react to this?"

**Offer suggestions**:

- "You could try talking to the shopkeeper, or maybe investigating the back alley..."
- "Your Pokemon seems to be trying to tell you something..."

**Use NPCs**:

- Have an NPC offer hints or advice
- Create a new character who needs help
- Have a Pokemon do something that creates new options

#### Pacing Tips

**Speed up when**:

- Players are bored or distracted
- Too much time on minor details
- Energy is flagging

**Slow down when**:

- Players are really engaged with roleplay
- They're making important decisions
- Someone needs time to understand the situation

**Transition techniques**:

- "Meanwhile, across town..."
- "A few hours later..."
- "Suddenly, you hear a loud noise!"
