## Dice System

Our game uses a simple dice system that's easy to learn and fun to use!

### What You Need

- **Six-sided dice (d6)** - These are regular dice like you'd find in most board games
- You only need one die to start, but sometimes you'll get to roll more!

### How Rolling Works

When you roll dice in this game, you're always looking for **5s and 6s** - these are your **successes**!

#### The Simple Rule

- **Roll your dice** (usually 1-4 dice depending on your character)
- **Count your successes**: Look for any 5s and 6s you rolled
- **More successes = better results**: The more 5s and 6s you get, the more amazing things happen!

#### What Each Die Result Means

- **1** = Adds complications to the story (but doesn't cancel successes!)
- **2, 3, 4** = Nothing special happens with these
- **5, 6** = SUCCESS! ‚úÖ Count these!

#### Success Results

- **0 successes**: Things don't go as planned, try a different approach
- **1 success**: You succeed, but something unexpected happens too
- **2-3 successes**: You succeed really well according to your plan
- **4+ successes**: Amazing success! You do even better than expected!

**Example**: If you roll 4 dice and get: 1, 2, 5, 6

- You have **2 successes** (the 5 and the 6) = You succeed really well!
- The 1 might add a small complication to make the story interesting
- The 2 doesn't matter

### When Do You Roll More Dice?

You might get to roll extra dice when:

- Your Pokemon partner helps you
- You have special training or skills
- You work together with friends
- You use the right tool for the job
- The Game Master decides your character is especially good at something

### Quick Reference

- **1 die**: Basic attempt
- **2 dice**: You have some help or advantage
- **3+ dice**: You're really prepared or have lots of help!

Remember: Even with multiple dice, rolling all 1s still means things don't go as planned. But that just means more exciting story moments!

#### Fun Math Practice

Rolling multiple dice is a great way to practice:

- **Counting**: How many 5s and 6s did you roll?
- **Addition**: Adding up your successes from different rolls
- **Probability**: Learning that more dice = better chances

**Quick Visual Guide:**

- 1 = üòê (Complication, but keep counting!)
- 2, 3, 4 = üò∂ (Nothing special)
- 5, 6 = üòä (SUCCESS! Count these!)

## Creating Your Character

In this game, you play as a Pokemon Trainer! Trainers are special people who explore the world, solve problems, and become best friends with Pokemon. Let's create your trainer character step by step.

### Trainer Stats

Your trainer has three important stats that show what they're good at. Each stat helps you in different situations during your adventures.

#### The Three Stats

**üß† Knowledge** - How smart and clever you are

- Use for: Solving puzzles, reading maps, remembering Pokemon types, figuring out riddles
- Example: "I remember that Fire-type moves don't work well against Water Pokemon!"

**üí™ Spirit** - How brave and determined you are

- Use for: Being courageous in scary situations, not giving up when things get tough, pushing through danger
- Example: "I won't let my Pokemon down! We can do this together!"

**üíñ Friendship** - How good you are with people and Pokemon

- Use for: Making new friends, convincing people to help you, cheering up sad Pokemon, working as a team
- Example: "Don't worry, little Pikachu. I believe in you!"

#### Setting Your Stats

Every trainer starts with **1 point** in each stat, and you get **6 extra points** to add wherever you want!

**Starting Stats**: Knowledge 1, Spirit 1, Friendship 1

**Extra Points**: You have 6 points to add to any stats you choose

**Examples of how to spend your points**:

- **The Scholar**: Knowledge 4, Spirit 2, Friendship 3 (loves learning and solving puzzles)
- **The Hero**: Knowledge 2, Spirit 4, Friendship 3 (brave and never gives up)
- **The Friend**: Knowledge 2, Spirit 2, Friendship 5 (makes friends with everyone)
- **The Balanced**: Knowledge 3, Spirit 3, Friendship 3 (good at everything)

#### How Stats Work with Dice

Your stats determine how many dice you get to roll when you try to do something:

##### Stat Rating ‚Üí Number of Dice

- **1-2 points**: Roll 1 die
- **3-4 points**: Roll 2 dice
- **5-6 points**: Roll 3 dice
- **7+ points**: Roll 4 dice

**Remember**: More dice = more chances to roll 5s and 6s = better chance of success!

#### Quick Stat Reference

| Stat Points | Dice to Roll | What This Means |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1-2         | 1 die        | You're learning |
| 3-4         | 2 dice       | You're good at this |
| 5-6         | 3 dice       | You're really skilled |
| 7+          | 4 dice       | You're amazing! |

### Character Creation Steps

1. **Choose your trainer's name** - What do you want to be called?
2. **Describe your trainer** - What do they look like? What do they wear? What's their personality?
3. **Set your stats** - Remember: Start with 1 in each, then add 6 points however you want
4. **Pick a hometown** - Where did your trainer grow up? A big city? A small town? Near the mountains or ocean?
5. **Choose your dream** - What does your trainer want to accomplish? Become the best trainer? Discover new Pokemon? Help Pokemon and people?

## Basic Gameplay

Now that you have your trainer character, let's learn how to play! This section covers the basic rules for adventures, challenges, and having fun with your friends.

### How the Game Works

#### The Game Master (GM)

- One person is the **Game Master** or **GM**
- The GM describes the world, plays the NPCs (non-player characters), and helps tell the story
- The GM doesn't try to "win" - they help everyone have fun adventures!

#### The Players

- Everyone else plays as **Pokemon Trainers**
- Players describe what their trainers want to do
- Players roll dice when the GM asks them to
- Players work together to solve problems and have adventures

#### Taking Turns

- The game doesn't have strict turns like a board game
- Players can talk and plan together anytime
- When action happens, the GM will ask specific players what they want to do
- Everyone gets chances to be the hero!

### When Do You Roll Dice?

You don't roll dice for everything! Here's when you DO and DON'T roll:

#### You DON'T Roll Dice For

- Talking to friends or NPCs
- Walking around normally
- Doing easy things your character would know how to do
- Planning with your team

#### You DO Roll Dice For

- Trying something difficult or risky
- When the outcome is uncertain
- When failure would make the story more interesting
- When the GM asks you to

### Making Skill Checks

When the GM asks you to roll dice, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: GM Tells You What to Roll

The GM will say something like:

- "Roll Knowledge to remember what type Charizard is"
- "Roll Spirit to be brave in the scary cave"
- "Roll Friendship to convince the angry Machamp to calm down"

#### Step 2: Count Your Dice

Add up your dice from:

- **Your stat** (1-4 dice based on your rating)
- **Your skill** (+1 die if you have a matching skill)
- **Help from friends** (+1 die if someone helps you)
- **Good ideas** (+1 die if your plan is really clever)
- **Right tools** (+1 die if you have the perfect item)

#### Step 3: Roll and Count Successes

- Roll all your dice
- Count how many show **5 or 6** (these are successes)
- Tell the GM your number of successes

#### Step 4: GM Describes What Happens

Based on your successes:

- **0 successes**: Things don't go as planned, but the story continues
- **1 success**: You succeed, but with a complication
- **2+ successes**: You succeed well! Maybe even better than expected

#### What About 1s (Failures)?

When rolling multiple dice, **only successes (5s and 6s) matter for your result**. Here's how it works:

- **1s don't cancel out successes** - If you roll [1, 1, 6], you still have 1 success!
- **1s add story complications** - The more 1s you roll, the more interesting complications might happen
- **Successes determine your main result** - Focus on counting 5s and 6s

**Examples of Mixed Results**:

**Roll [1, 2, 5, 6]** = **2 successes**

- You succeed well, but the 1 might add a small complication
- "You identify the Pokemon perfectly, but you accidentally step on a twig and alert it to your presence"

**Roll [1, 1, 1, 6]** = **1 success**

- You succeed with complications, and those 1s suggest bigger problems
- "You figure out it's a Ditto, but your loud excitement scares it away before you can study it more"

**Roll [1, 1, 2, 3]** = **0 successes**

- The 1s make things particularly challenging
- "Not only can't you identify the Pokemon, but you trip over your own feet and fall into a berry bush"

#### Quick Success Guide

| Successes | What Happens | Story Result |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| 0 | Failure | Try a different approach or face a setback |
| 1 | Success with complications | You get what you want, but something unexpected happens |
| 2-3 | Clear success | Things go according to plan |
| 4+ | Amazing success | You succeed beyond your wildest dreams! |

### Example Skill Check

**Situation**: Maya wants to identify a wild Pokemon she's never seen before.

**GM**: "Maya, roll Knowledge to see if you can identify this Pokemon."

**Maya's Player**:

- "I have Knowledge 5, so that's 3 dice"
- "I have Pokemon Expert skill, so +1 die"
- "I'm using my Pokedex, so +1 die for having the right tool"
- "Total: 5 dice!"

**Maya rolls**: 2, 4, 5, 6, 6 = **3 successes!**

**GM**: "You immediately recognize this as a Ditto! You also remember that Ditto can transform into any Pokemon it sees, and you notice it's watching your Pikachu very carefully."

### Working Together

Pokemon training is about teamwork! Here are ways to help each other:

#### Helping a Friend

- When a friend tries something difficult, you can help
- Describe how you're helping: "I hold the flashlight so Maya can read the map better"
- If your help makes sense, you give them **+1 die**
- Only one person can help with each action

#### Group Actions

- Sometimes everyone works together on the same task
- Each person rolls their own dice
- Count successes from everyone
- More people = more chances for success!

#### Taking Turns Being Awesome

- Make sure everyone gets to be the hero sometimes
- If someone hasn't done much lately, let them try the next challenge
- Celebrate each other's successes!

### Failure and Setbacks

Rolling poorly isn't the end of the world! Here's how to handle setbacks:

#### When You Fail

- **It's not your fault** - sometimes dice just don't cooperate
- **The story continues** - failure often leads to new adventures
- **Try a different approach** - maybe there's another way
- **Ask friends for help** - teamwork makes everything better

#### Learning from Failure

- Each failure teaches you something new
- You might discover a secret or learn important information
- Sometimes "failing" leads to even better outcomes
- The best stories come from overcoming challenges

### Adventure Flow

Most adventures follow this pattern:

#### 1. Explore

- Travel to new places
- Meet new people and Pokemon
- Discover mysteries and clues

#### 2. Encounter Challenges

- Solve puzzles or problems
- Help people or Pokemon in need
- Overcome obstacles

#### 3. Make Choices

- Decide how to handle situations
- Choose which path to take
- Work together to make plans

#### 4. Resolve and Continue

- See the results of your actions
- Learn from what happened
- Move on to the next adventure

Remember: The goal is to have fun, be creative, and tell an amazing story together!

## Pokemon Partners

Every trainer has a special Pokemon partner who goes on adventures with them! Your Pokemon partner is your best friend, helper, and teammate. Let's learn how Pokemon work in this game.

### Pokemon Stats

Just like trainers, Pokemon have three important stats that show what they're good at:

#### The Three Pokemon Stats

**üí™ Strength** - How strong and tough your Pokemon is

- Use for: Attacking enemies, lifting heavy things, breaking obstacles, protecting friends
- Example: "Machop uses its strong arms to move the big boulder blocking our path!"

**‚ö° Speed** - How fast and agile your Pokemon is

- Use for: Dodging attacks, running quickly, climbing, jumping, catching things
- Example: "Pikachu is so quick, it dodges the falling rocks and runs to safety!"

**üíñ Heart** - How loyal and caring your Pokemon is

- Use for: Listening to trainer commands, helping teammates, cheering others up, working together
- Example: "Eevee nuzzles the scared Pidgey to make it feel brave again!"

### Pokemon Stages

Instead of levels, Pokemon grow through **Stages**. As your Pokemon gains experience and learns new things, it moves to higher stages!

#### Stage Growth Chart

| Stage | Dice per Stat | Max Moves | What This Means |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Stage 1 | 1 die | 1 move | Your Pokemon is just starting its journey |
| Stage 2 | 1 die | 2 moves | Your Pokemon is learning and growing |
| Stage 3 | 2 dice | 3 moves | Your Pokemon is getting skilled |
| Stage 4 | 3 dice | 4 moves | Your Pokemon is amazingly powerful! |

#### How Stages Work

- **All Pokemon start at Stage 1** with 1 die for each stat
- **Higher stages** let your Pokemon roll more dice for their actions
- **More moves** mean more options in different situations
- **Stages might include evolution** - your Charmander might become Charmeleon!

### Pokemon Evolution

Evolution is a special way Pokemon can change their appearance and sometimes gain new abilities while keeping the same stage power level!

#### How Evolution Works

**Evolution is Optional**: Not all Pokemon need to evolve to be powerful. A Stage 4 Pikachu is just as strong as a Stage 4 Raichu!

**Evolution Timing**: Pokemon can choose to evolve when they reach certain stages:

- **Stage 2**: First evolution (Charmander ‚Üí Charmeleon)
- **Stage 3**: Final evolution (Charmeleon ‚Üí Charizard)

**What Changes**: When your Pokemon evolves:

- **Appearance**: They look different and might get bigger
- **Name**: Charmander becomes Charmeleon, then Charizard
- **Personality**: They might become more confident or mature
- **New Move Options**: They might learn evolution-specific moves

**What Stays the Same**: Evolution doesn't change:

- **Stage Level**: A Stage 2 Charmeleon has the same power as any Stage 2 Pokemon
- **Stat Points**: You keep the same stat distribution
- **Dice Count**: Still determined by stage, not evolution
- **EXP**: Your Pokemon keeps all their experience

#### Evolution Examples

**Charmander Evolution Line**:

- **Stage 1**: Charmander (starting form)
- **Stage 2**: Can choose to evolve into Charmeleon
- **Stage 3**: Charmeleon can evolve into Charizard
- **Stage 4**: Charizard reaches peak power (future: maybe Mega Evolution!)

**Pikachu Evolution Line**:

- **Any Stage**: Pikachu can choose to evolve into Raichu
- **Or Stay**: Pikachu can remain Pikachu forever and be just as powerful!

**Eevee Evolution Options**:

- **Stage 2**: Eevee can evolve into Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, or others
- **Player Choice**: Pick the evolution that fits your story best

#### Making Evolution Special

**Evolution Stories**: When your Pokemon evolves, create a special moment:

- "After protecting the village from the rockslide, Charmander glows with pride and evolves into Charmeleon!"
- "Seeing its trainer in danger gives Pikachu the courage to evolve into Raichu!"

**Evolution Moves**: Some moves are only available after evolution:

- **Charizard** might learn "Fly" (a special Heart move for helping teammates reach high places)
- **Raichu** might learn "Thunder" (a powerful Strength move)
- **Vaporeon** might learn "Surf" (a Speed move for water travel)

**GM Collaboration**: Work with your GM to decide:

- When evolution feels right for the story
- What new moves might become available
- How the evolution changes your Pokemon's personality

#### Evolution is About Choice, Not Power

Remember: Evolution is about **story and fun**, not about getting stronger. A Pokemon that never evolves can be just as heroic and powerful as one that evolves multiple times. Choose what feels right for your Pokemon's story!

### Experience Points (EXP)

Pokemon grow stronger by gaining **Experience Points** or **EXP**!

#### How to Earn EXP

Your Pokemon gains EXP when:

- **They succeed at something important** (1 EXP per success rolled)
- **They help solve a big problem** (bonus EXP from GM)
- **They make new friends** (1 EXP for good social interactions)
- **They learn something new** (1 EXP for discovering things)

#### EXP Requirements for Stages

| Stage | Total EXP Needed | EXP to Next Stage |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| Stage 1 | 0 EXP | Need 5 EXP |
| Stage 2 | 5 EXP | Need 10 more EXP (15 total) |
| Stage 3 | 15 EXP | Need 15 more EXP (30 total) |
| Stage 4 | 30 EXP | Maximum stage! |

### Pokemon Moves

#### Pokemon Types and Type Advantages

Every Pokemon has one or two **types** (like Fire, Water, Grass, etc.). When your Pokemon uses a move that matches a situation really well, they get a bonus!

#### Type Advantage Bonus

When your Pokemon's type or move type is **super effective** for the situation, add **+1 extra die** to your roll!

**Examples of Type Advantages**:

**Fire Types/Moves are great for**:

2. **Choose the right Pokemon/Move**: "My Charmander uses Sunny Day!"
3. **Explain why it's effective**: "Fire melts ice really well!"
4. **Get the bonus**: Roll your normal dice + 1 extra die for type advantage
5. **GM confirms**: The GM decides if the type advantage makes sense

#### Type Chart for GMs and Older Kids

**Situation Types ‚Üí Helpful Pokemon/Move Types**:

- **Water Obstacles** ‚Üí Electric or Grass types
- **Rock/Earth Barriers** ‚Üí Water or Grass types
- **High Places** ‚Üí Flying types
- **Dark Areas** ‚Üí Electric or Fire types
- **Mechanical Problems** ‚Üí Electric or Steel types
- **Scared Pokemon** ‚Üí Normal or Psychic types
- **Poison/Sickness** ‚Üí Grass or Psychic types

#### Dual-Type Pokemon and Moves

Many Pokemon have **two types** instead of just one! This makes them extra versatile and gives them more opportunities for type advantages.

**How Dual-Type Pokemon Work**:

**Examples of Dual-Type Pokemon**:

- **Charizard**: Fire/Flying (can help with heat problems AND reaching high places)
- **Gyarados**: Water/Flying (can help with water travel AND aerial scouting)
- **Crobat**: Poison/Flying (can neutralize toxins AND fly quickly)
- **Skarmory**: Steel/Flying (can cut through metal AND reach high places)

**Dual-Type Advantages**:

- **More opportunities**: Your Pokemon can get type advantages in more situations
- **Flexible solutions**: One Pokemon can solve different kinds of problems
- **Only need one match**: If either type helps, you get the +1 die bonus

**Example**: Your Charizard faces an icy cliff

- **Fire type** helps melt the ice (+1 die)
- **Flying type** helps reach the top (+1 die)
- **You choose**: Pick whichever type advantage makes the most sense for your approach
- **No stacking**: You still only get +1 die total, not +2

**Dual-Type Moves**:

Some moves combine two types! These are extra special and rare.

**Examples of Dual-Type Moves**:

- **Flying Flame** (Fire/Flying): Create fire tornados to clear obstacles
- **Muddy Water** (Water/Ground): Create helpful mud slides or track footprints
- **Grass Knot** (Grass/Fighting): Use vines to climb or tie things together
- **Steel Wing** (Steel/Flying): Cut through barriers while flying

**Learning Dual-Type Moves**:

- **Cost more EXP**: Dual-type moves cost 5 EXP instead of 3 EXP
- **More versatile**: Can get type advantages in more situations
- **Special requirement**: Usually need to be Stage 3 or higher to learn them
- **GM approval**: Work with your GM to create moves that fit your Pokemon's story

**Dual-Type Move Advantages**:

- **Either type counts**: If the situation matches Fire OR Flying, Flying Flame gets the bonus
- **Creative solutions**: Dual-type moves often solve problems in unique ways
- **Story moments**: Perfect for dramatic scenes and character development

#### Learning New Moves

- **Your Pokemon starts** with 1 move that fits their personality
- **Spend 3 EXP** to learn a new move (if your stage allows it)
- **Spend 2 EXP** to replace an old move with a new one
- **Ask your GM** about special moves that fit your Pokemon's story

### Using Pokemon in Adventures

There are three different ways trainers and Pokemon can work together, each with its own rules:

#### 1. Pokemon Acting Independently

When your Pokemon does something on their own without trainer direction:

- **Pokemon rolls their own dice**: Use the Pokemon's stats (Strength, Speed, or Heart)
- **Use Pokemon's stage**: Roll the number of dice for their current stage
- **Pokemon gains EXP**: They get experience from their own successes
- **Examples**:
  - "Pikachu notices the danger and uses Quick Attack to dodge on its own"
  - "Charmander gets scared and hides behind a rock"
  - "Eevee makes friends with the wild Pidgey without being asked"

#### 2. Trainer Directing Pokemon

When the trainer tells their Pokemon what to do:

- **Pokemon rolls their dice**: Use Pokemon stats and stage
- **Add +1 helper die**: The trainer's guidance gives one extra die
- **Trainer describes the command**: "Go, Charizard! Use Sunny Day!"
- **Pokemon gains EXP**: They get experience from successes
- **Examples**:
  - "I tell my Squirtle to use Water Jet to put out the fire"
  - "Go, Machop! Use your strength to move that boulder!"
  - "Pikachu, help that scared Pokemon feel better!"

#### 3. Trainer and Pokemon Working Together

When both trainer and Pokemon are actively involved in the same action:

- **Roll all dice together**: Combine trainer dice + Pokemon dice + any bonuses
- **Count total successes**: Add up all the 5s and 6s from both rolls
- **Both can gain EXP**: Great teamwork benefits everyone

### Pokemon Battles

Sometimes during your adventures, you might need to battle other Pokemon! This could be a wild Pokemon defending its territory, a friendly competition with another trainer, or protecting someone from danger. Our battle system is simple but exciting, with room for strategy and surprises.

#### When Battles Happen

**Wild Pokemon encounters**: A Pokemon blocks your path or protects something important

**Trainer challenges**: Other trainers want to test their skills against yours

**Guardian battles**: Special Pokemon guard ancient ruins or sacred places

**Friendly competitions**: Pokemon contests, gym challenges, or training matches

**Emergency defense**: Protecting people or Pokemon from aggressive wild Pokemon

Remember: Your GM will help decide when battles happen and guide you toward the best solutions for each situation.

#### Basic Battle Rules

##### Step 1: Choose Your Approach

Decide what your Pokemon will try to do:

- **Attack** (Strength): Try to overwhelm the opponent with power
- **Outmaneuver** (Speed): Use agility to gain advantage
- **Intimidate/Befriend** (Heart): Use personality to influence the opponent

##### Step 2: Opposed Rolls

- Both Pokemon roll dice for their chosen approach
- Use the appropriate stat (Strength, Speed, or Heart)
- Roll the number of dice for your Pokemon's current stage
- Count successes (5s and 6s) for each Pokemon

##### Step 3: Compare Results

- **More successes**: Your Pokemon gains the advantage this round
- **Equal successes**: It's a tie - both Pokemon are evenly matched
- **Fewer successes**: The opponent gains the advantage

##### Step 4: Describe What Happens

The GM describes the action based on the results:

- **Clear winner**: The winning Pokemon makes good progress toward victory
- **Close contest**: Both Pokemon are still actively battling
- **Dramatic moment**: Something unexpected might happen!

#### Battle Examples

##### Example 1: Wild Snorlax Blocking the Path

*Round 1*:

- **Your Pikachu**: Uses Speed to try dodging around Snorlax
- **Pikachu rolls**: 2, 5, 6 = **2 successes**
- **Snorlax**: Uses Strength to grab Pikachu
- **Snorlax rolls**: 1, 3, 4, 5 = **1 success**
- **Result**: Pikachu successfully dodges around but Snorlax is still blocking everyone else

*Round 2*:

- **Your Pikachu**: Uses Heart to try befriending Snorlax
- **Pikachu rolls**: 4, 5, 6 = **2 successes**
- **Snorlax**: Uses Heart to show it's just protecting its nap spot
- **Snorlax rolls**: 2, 6, 6, 6 = **3 successes**
- **Result**: Snorlax communicates that it just wants to sleep peacefully. Maybe you can find another way around?

##### Example 2: Gym Leader Challenge

*Round 1*:

- **Your Charmander**: Uses Strength to attack with Flame Punch
- **Charmander rolls**: 3, 5 = **1 success**
- **Gym Leader's Squirtle**: Uses Speed to dodge and counter
- **Squirtle rolls**: 2, 4, 6 = **1 success**
- **Result**: Both Pokemon are evenly matched so far!

*Round 2*:

- **Your Charmander**: Uses Heart to show determination and courage
- **Charmander rolls**: 1, 6 = **1 success** (the 1 adds a complication)
- **Squirtle**: Uses Strength for a Water Gun attack
- **Squirtle rolls**: 5, 5, 6 = **3 successes**
- **Result**: Charmander fights bravely but gets overwhelmed. The 1 means Charmander is getting tired and might need to rest soon.

#### Winning and Losing Battles

**When Your Pokemon Wins**:

- **Gain 1-2 EXP**: Battles are great learning experiences
- **Story progress**: You overcome the obstacle or earn respect
- **New opportunities**: Victory might open new paths or options

**When Your Pokemon Loses**:

- **Still gain 1 EXP**: Pokemon learn from every battle experience
- **Need to rest**: Your Pokemon is tired and needs a break before battling again
- **Try different approach**: Maybe there's another way to solve the problem
- **Story continues**: The GM helps you find what happens next

**Important**: Losing a battle doesn't mean your Pokemon is hurt badly! They're just tired and need to rest. Pokemon Centers, taking a nap, or having a snack can help them recover.

#### Battle Strategy Tips

**Choose the Right Stat**:

- **Strength**: Good against opponents who rely on tricks or speed
- **Speed**: Good against slow, powerful opponents
- **Heart**: Good for making friends or intimidating bullies

**Use Type Advantages**:

- If your Pokemon's type gives an advantage, add +1 die to your roll
- Think about how your Pokemon's abilities could help in creative ways

**Work as a Team**:

- Your trainer can help by giving encouragement (+1 die)
- Multiple Pokemon can battle together in some situations
- Use items or tools to give your Pokemon advantages

**Read the Situation**:

- Sometimes the opponent doesn't want to fight either
- Look for clues about what the Pokemon really wants
- Be ready to switch from battling to problem-solving

#### Team Battles

Sometimes multiple trainers can battle together!

**When Team Battles Happen**:

- Facing a very powerful Pokemon (like a legendary)
- Protecting a large area or many people
- Special events like tournaments or festivals
- When the GM decides it would be more fun

**Team Battle Rules**:

- Each trainer's Pokemon acts on their own turn
- You can coordinate strategies between turns
- All Pokemon on the team can gain EXP from the experience
- The GM might adjust the opponent's power to match multiple Pokemon

#### Alternative Battle Outcomes

Remember: Not every "battle" has to end with one Pokemon defeating another!

**Creative Solutions**:

- **Befriending**: Turn an enemy into an ally
- **Distraction**: Get the Pokemon to focus on something else
- **Environmental**: Change the situation so battling isn't needed
- **Negotiation**: Figure out what the Pokemon really wants

**Example**: Instead of defeating the Snorlax blocking the path, you might:

- Find berries to satisfy its hunger
- Discover it's protecting baby Pokemon and help relocate them safely
- Create a comfortable sleeping spot elsewhere
- Ask a Flying-type Pokemon to carry everyone over it

#### Battle Safety

**Keep It Fun**:

- No Pokemon should be permanently hurt
- Everyone gets chances to try different strategies
- Celebrate creative thinking, not just winning
- Help newer players understand the rules

**Learn from Every Battle**:

- Win or lose, every battle teaches something
- Talk about what worked and what didn't
- Encourage players to try new approaches
- Remember that Pokemon battles are about growth and friendship

Remember: The best battles are the ones where everyone has fun, learns something new, and creates exciting stories together!
