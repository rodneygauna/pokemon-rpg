## Adventure Overview

**Setting**: Greenleaf Town, a small community on the edge of Greenleaf Forest
**Time**: Early afternoon during the town's monthly Trainer Gathering
**Tone**: Friendly, cooperative, and gently mysterious
**Goal**: Help solve the forest guardian mystery while learning to work together

### What's Happening

Greenleaf Town holds monthly gatherings where traveling trainers can rest, resupply, and share stories. Today's gathering has been disrupted by reports of a mysterious Pokemon blocking the main forest path. This Pokemon isn't attacking anyone, but it won't let trainers pass deeper into the forest where valuable berries and rare Pokemon can be found.

The town's mayor, Mrs. Elmwood, has asked for brave trainers to investigate peacefully and find out what this Pokemon wants.

## Character Introduction (10 minutes)

### The Town Square Scene

*Read or paraphrase to players:*

"You find yourselves in the cozy town square of Greenleaf Town during their monthly Trainer Gathering. Colorful banners flutter between the lamp posts, and the smell of fresh berry pies drifts from nearby food stalls. Trainers of all ages sit on benches sharing stories, while their Pokemon play together on the grass.

Mayor Elmwood, a kind woman with silver hair, stands on the small wooden platform in the center of the square. She looks a bit worried as she addresses the gathered crowd."

**Mayor Elmwood says**: "Thank you all for coming to our gathering! Unfortunately, we have a small problem. For the past three days, a mysterious Pokemon has been blocking the main path into Greenleaf Forest. It's not hurting anyone, but it won't let trainers pass. We're hoping some brave souls might help us figure out what it wants!"

### Player Introductions

Go around the table and ask each player:

1. **"What does your trainer look like, and how did they arrive in Greenleaf Town?"**
2. **"What Pokemon partner is with you, and how are they reacting to all the activity?"**
3. **"Why might your trainer be interested in helping with this forest mystery?"**

**GM Notes**:

- Let players describe their characters and Pokemon freely
- Ask follow-up questions to help shy players ("What's your Pokemon's favorite thing to do?")
- Help players connect to each other ("Oh, you both have Electric-type Pokemon!")
- If players need starter Pokemon, Mrs. Elmwood can introduce them to Professor Elmwood (her daughter) who has some partner Pokemon available

### Forming the Group

After introductions, have the players naturally decide to work together. You can prompt this with:

- "It sounds like you're all interested in helping! Would you like to team up?"
- "Mayor Elmwood notices you all stepping forward and smiles. 'A team approach sounds perfect!'"

## Investigation Phase (20 minutes)

Before heading to the forest, the trainers can gather information around town. Present these options and let players choose what interests them:

### Option 1: Talk to Other Trainers

**NPCs Present**:

**Jake the Hiker** (with his Geodude):

- **What he knows**: "I tried to go through yesterday. The Pokemon is definitely powerful - it's a Snorlax! But it seemed more sad than angry."
- **Knowledge Check (1 success)**: Players remember that Snorlax are usually very friendly and only block paths when something's wrong
- **Pokemon Whisperer Skill**: Gets hint that Snorlax seemed to be protecting something

**Lily the Bug Catcher** (with her Caterpie):

- **What she knows**: "I've been collecting berries from the forest edge for weeks. Usually there are lots of Pidgey and Rattata, but they've all moved away from that area."
- **Navigator Skill**: She can show them the best way to approach the blocked path quietly

### Option 2: Visit the Pokemon Center

**Nurse Joy** has helpful information:

- **What she knows**: "No injured Pokemon have come from that area, which is good news! Whatever's happening isn't causing fights."
- **Kind Helper Skill**: Nurse Joy offers some Oran Berries that might help if they need to calm an upset Pokemon
- **Knowledge Check (1 success)**: Players can research Snorlax behavior in the Center's computer

### Option 3: Check the Local Shop

**Shop Keeper Tom**:

- **What he knows**: "Sales of berries and forest supplies have dropped because trainers can't get deep into the forest. The path has been blocked right at the old wooden bridge."
- **If asked about Snorlax**: "They love to eat and sleep. Maybe it's hungry? Or maybe its favorite sleeping spot is in trouble?"

### Option 4: Talk to Mayor Elmwood

**Additional Information**:

- **What she knows**: "This started three days ago, right after that big thunderstorm we had. Maybe it's connected?"
- **Researcher Skill**: She mentions that the town library has maps of the forest that might show what's near the bridge

## The Forest Approach (15 minutes)

### Getting to the Forest

The path from town to the forest takes about 10 minutes of walking. Use this time for:

- **Character bonding**: Let players talk and get to know each other
- **Pokemon interactions**: Their Pokemon can play together or show off abilities
- **Simple challenges**: Maybe a small creek to cross or a fallen log to move

### Approaching the Blocked Path

*Read or paraphrase:*

"You arrive at the edge of Greenleaf Forest where the main path begins. Tall trees create a green canopy overhead, and you can hear the gentle sounds of wild Pokemon in the distance. About fifty feet ahead, you can see the old wooden bridge that crosses a small stream. And there, sitting right in the middle of the bridge, is a massive Snorlax!"

### Initial Observation

Let players decide how to approach. They might:

- **Sneak closer to observe** (Spirit Check, 1 success)
- **Try to understand what Snorlax is doing** (Knowledge or Pokemon Whisperer, 1 success)
- **Look around the area for clues** (Navigator skill or Knowledge, 1 success)

### What They Can Discover

**Successful observation reveals**:

- Snorlax keeps looking down at the stream under the bridge
- It seems restless and worried, not sleepy like usual
- There are broken wooden planks on one side of the bridge
- The stream is running faster and muddier than normal

**With 2+ successes or Pokemon Whisperer**:

- Snorlax is making soft, concerned noises toward the water
- Its body language shows it's protecting something, not just being stubborn

## The Mystery Revealed (10 minutes)

### Investigating Further

If players investigate the stream or bridge area:

**Knowledge Check (1 success)**: The recent storm must have damaged the bridge and stirred up the stream

**Friendship Check with Snorlax (1 success)**: Snorlax responds positively and points toward the water with its big paw

**Looking in the stream (Spirit Check, 1 success needed to brave getting close to Snorlax)**:

*The mystery is revealed!*

### The Truth

In the muddy, fast-moving stream, trapped between some rocks and a broken bridge plank, is a small family of Poliwag! The baby Poliwag are too young to swim against the current, and the adult Poliwag can't move them all to safety alone.

Snorlax has been guarding the bridge to make sure no one accidentally makes the situation worse by walking across and potentially dropping more debris into the water.

### Snorlax's Reaction

When the trainers show they understand the problem:

- Snorlax becomes visibly relieved and happy
- It gestures toward the Poliwag and makes gentle sounds
- Pokemon Whisperer or Heart Pokemon can "translate": "Please help my friends!"

## The Rescue Mission (12 minutes)

### Planning the Solution

Let players come up with creative ideas! Some possibilities:

**Use Pokemon Abilities**:

- Water-type Pokemon can swim down and help guide Poliwag to safety
- Flying-type Pokemon can carry small Poliwag
- Strong Pokemon can carefully move the rocks

**Use Trainer Skills**:

- Spirit Check (1 success) to carefully wade into the stream
- Knowledge Check (1 success) to figure out which rocks to move first
- Friendship Check (1 success) to coordinate with Snorlax's help

**Work as a Team**:

- Multiple trainers can help each other (+1 die for assistance)
- Pokemon can work together for bigger tasks

### Possible Challenges

**Moving the Debris** (Spirit or Pokemon Strength, 1 success):

- Success: The rocks and plank are moved safely
- Failure: The current gets stronger, making rescue more urgent (time pressure, but no real danger)

**Calming the Poliwag** (Friendship or Pokemon Heart, 1 success):

- Success: The Poliwag family trusts the trainers and cooperates
- Failure: The baby Poliwag are scared and try to hide, making rescue trickier

**Coordinating the Rescue** (Team Leadership or working together, 1-2 successes):

- 1 success: Rescue works but takes longer, everyone gets muddy
- 2+ successes: Smooth operation, everyone stays dry and safe

### The Rescue Success

However they do it, make sure the rescue succeeds! Describe:

- The Poliwag family safely reunited on the shore
- The adult Poliwag doing happy little hops
- The babies chirping gratefully
- Snorlax beaming with joy and relief

## The Grateful Guardian (8 minutes)

### Snorlax's Thanks

With the Poliwag family safe, Snorlax is incredibly grateful:

- It does a happy dance (surprisingly graceful for such a big Pokemon!)
- It offers to share some rare berries it had been saving
- It moves off the bridge and gestures for trainers to pass

### Battle Challenge (Optional)

If players are interested in testing their battle skills:

**Snorlax challenges the group to a friendly battle** to show its appreciation and test their skills!

**Battle Setup**:

- This is a practice battle, no one gets hurt
- Snorlax uses Heart to show it's having fun (3 dice, Stage 4)
- Each trainer can have their Pokemon take one action
- The goal is everyone having fun, not winning or losing

**Battle Resolution**:

- Let each Pokemon try one approach (Strength, Speed, or Heart)
- Count total successes from all trainers
- Regardless of results, Snorlax is impressed and everyone has fun
- Award 1 EXP to all Pokemon for the experience

### Rewards and Recognition

**Experience Points**: Each Pokemon gains 1 EXP for helping solve the crisis

**New Friends**: The Poliwag family and Snorlax will remember the trainers' kindness

**Forest Access**: The path is now open, and Snorlax offers to guide them deeper into the forest anytime

**Town Gratitude**: Word of their success will spread quickly in Greenleaf Town

## Returning to Town (5 minutes)

### The Victory Celebration

When trainers return to Greenleaf Town:

- Mayor Elmwood is delighted and thanks them publicly
- Other trainers at the gathering cheer and ask to hear the story
- The town offers the heroes a free meal and a place to stay
- Shop Keeper Tom gives them each a small discount on supplies

### Setting Up Future Adventures

**Possible hooks for next time**:

- Snorlax mentions other mysteries deeper in the forest
- The Poliwag family's grateful parents want to show them a secret grotto
- Mayor Elmwood has heard rumors of rare Pokemon sightings
- Other trainers ask to join their group for future adventures

## GM Notes and Tips

### Managing Time

- **If running short**: Skip some investigation options and go straight to the forest
- **If running long**: Have NPCs give information more directly
- **Keep energy up**: Use Pokemon reactions and expressions to maintain engagement

### Handling Different Players

**For shy players**:

- Ask their Pokemon what they think about situations
- Give them specific, easy tasks ("Can you roll to see if your Pokemon notices anything?")
- Pair them with confident players for team actions

**For experienced players**:

- Let them help other players with rules
- Ask them to describe their Pokemon's actions in detail
- Give them slightly more complex challenges

**For young players**:

- Use simple, clear descriptions
- Let automatic successes happen for good roleplay
- Focus on their Pokemon's friendship and caring

### Adaptation Notes

**If players struggle with challenges**:

- Reduce success requirements to automatic
- Have NPCs provide more hints
- Let Pokemon solve problems with minimal rolling

**If players breeze through challenges**:

- Add weather complications (light rain, slippery rocks)
- Include more NPCs with information to gather
- Make the rescue coordination more complex

### Key Teaching Moments

1. **Dice Rolling**: Start with simple, low-stakes rolls
2. **Teamwork**: Show how helping friends gives bonus dice
3. **Pokemon Partnership**: Demonstrate how Pokemon can assist trainers
4. **Creative Problem-Solving**: Reward clever approaches with automatic successes
5. **Battle Basics**: Keep the optional battle simple and fun-focused

### Success Indicators

**You'll know the adventure is working when**:

- Players are describing their actions in character
- Everyone has rolled dice at least 2-3 times
- Players are suggesting ways to help each other
- There's laughter and excitement around the table
- Players are asking about future adventures

### Emergency Adjustments

**If the mystery feels too complex**: Have Snorlax point directly at the stream earlier

**If battle feels too hard**: Let Pokemon automatically succeed with creative descriptions

**If time runs short**: Skip the return to town and end with the rescue celebration

**If players get stuck**: Have their Pokemon react to clues or introduce a helpful NPC
